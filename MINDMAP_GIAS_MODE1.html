GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS/● Stakeholder Guidance ● Standards Board ● Oversight & Staff/The Institute of Internal Auditors is grateful to the stakeholders that provided guidance and assistance in the development of the Global Internal Audit Standards™.  The IIA particularly recognizes members of the International Internal Audit Standards Board – a global group of internal auditors who have generously volunteered their time and expertise to ensure the Standards elevate the professional practice of internal auditing.  The IIA thanks the International Professional Practices Framework Oversight Council for its essential role in ensuring the standard-setting process serves the public interest, the Professional Certifications Board for its advice, and IIA staff and technical advisors for ensuring the successful implementation and management of all aspects of the project.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK/● Structural Blueprint ● Official Information ● Key Components/A framework provides a structural blueprint and coherent system that facilitates the consistent development, interpretation, and application of a body of knowledge useful to a discipline or profession.  The International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF)® organizes the authoritative body of knowledge, promulgated by The Institute of Internal Auditors, for the professional practice of internal auditing.  The IPPF includes Global Internal Audit Standards, Topical Requirements, and Global Guidance.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK/● Current Practices ● Adapt to Change ● Diverse Organizations/The IPPF addresses current internal audit practices while enabling practitioners and stakeholders globally to be flexible and responsive to the ongoing needs for high-quality internal auditing in diverse environments and organizations of different purposes, sizes, and structures.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK  / MANDATORY/● Audit Guidelines ● 15 Principles ● Standard Elements/**Global Internal Audit Standards** Global Internal Audit Standards guide the worldwide professional practice of internal auditing and serve as a basis for evaluating and elevating the quality of the internal audit function.  At the heart of the Standards are 15 guiding principles that enable effective internal auditing.  Each principle is supported by standards that contain requirements, considerations for implementation, and examples of evidence of conformance.  Together, these elements help internal auditors achieve the principles and fulfill the Purpose of Internal Auditing.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK  / MANDATORY/● Consistent Quality ● Follow Requirements ● Address Risks/**Topical Requirements** Topical Requirements are designed to enhance the consistency and quality of internal audit services related to specific audit subjects and to support internal auditors performing engagements in those risk areas.  Internal auditors must conform with the relevant requirements when the scope of an engagement includes one of the identified topics.  Topical Requirements strengthen the ongoing relevance of internal auditing in addressing the evolving risk landscape across industries and sectors.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK  / SUPPLEMENTAL/● Extra information ● IIA support/**Global Guidance** Global Guidance supports the Standards by providing nonmandatory information, advice, and best practices for performing internal audit services.  It is endorsed by The IIA through formal review and approval processes.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK  / SUPPLEMENTAL/● Detailed Approaches ● Audit Coverage ● Specific Areas/Global Practice Guides provide detailed approaches, step-by-step processes, and examples on subjects including:  • Assurance and advisory services. • Engagement planning, performance, and communication. • Financial services. • Fraud and other pervasive risks. • Strategy and management of the internal audit function. • Public sector. • Sustainability.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES FRAMEWORK  / SUPPLEMENTAL/● Audit Technology Risks/Global Technology Audit Guides (GTAG®) provide auditors with the knowledge to perform assurance or consulting services related to an organization’s information technology and information security risks and controls.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS/● Audit Standards Guide ● 15 Guiding Principles ● Standards Elements Support/The Institute of Internal Auditors’ Global Internal Audit Standards guide the worldwide professional practice of internal auditing and serve as a basis for evaluating and elevating the quality of the internal audit function.  At the heart of the Standards are 15 guiding principles that enable effective internal auditing.  Each principle is supported by standards that contain requirements, considerations for implementation, and examples of evidence of conformance.  Together, these elements help internal auditors achieve the principles and fulfill the Purpose of Internal Auditing.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / INTERNAL AUDITING AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST/● Societal Well●being ● Context Matters/Public interest encompasses the social and economic interests and overall well-being of a society and the organizations operating within that society (including those of employers, employees, investors, the business and financial community, clients, customers, regulators, and government).  Questions of public interest are context specific and should weigh ethics, fairness, cultural norms and values, and potential disparate impacts on certain individuals and subgroups of society.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / INTERNAL AUDITING AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST/● Serves Public ● Improves Governance ● Builds Stability/Internal auditing plays a critical role in enhancing an organization’s ability to serve the public interest.  While the primary function of internal auditing is to strengthen governance, risk management, and control processes, its effects extend beyond the organization.  Internal auditing contributes to an organization’s overall stability and sustainability by providing assurance on its operational efficiency, reliability of reporting, compliance with laws and/or regulations, safeguarding of assets, and ethical culture.  This, in turn, fosters public trust and confidence in the organization and the broader systems of which it is a part.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / INTERNAL AUDITING AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST/● Public Input ● Standards Board ● Due Process ● Stakeholder Needs/The IIA is committed to setting standards with input from the public and to benefit the public.  International Internal Audit Standards Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Standards in the interest of the public.  This is achieved through an extensive, ongoing due process overseen by an independent body, the IPPF Oversight Council.  The process includes soliciting input from and considering the interests of various stakeholders—including internal audit practitioners, industry experts, government bodies, regulatory agencies, public representatives, and others—so that the Standards reflect the diverse needs and priorities of society.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICABILITY AND ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS/● Audit Guidelines ● Applies to All ● Organization Variety/The Global Internal Audit Standards set forth principles, requirements, considerations, and examples for the professional practice of internal auditing globally.  The Standards apply to any individual or function that provides internal audit services, whether an organization employs internal auditors directly, contracts them through an external service provider, or both.  Organizations receiving internal audit services vary in sector and industry affiliation, purpose, size, complexity, and structure.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICABILITY AND ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS/● Standards Application ● CAE Accountability/The Standards apply to the internal audit function and individual internal auditors including the chief audit executive.  While the chief audit executive is accountable for the internal audit function’s implementation of and conformance with all principles and standards, all internal auditors are responsible for conforming with the principles and standards relevant to performing their job responsibilities, which are presented primarily in Domain II: Ethics and Professionalism and Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICABILITY AND ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS/● Five Domains ● Audit Purpose ● Ethics Focus ● Governance ● Function Management ● Service Performance/The Standards are organized into five domains: • Domain I: Purpose of Internal Auditing. • Domain II: Ethics and Professionalism. • Domain III: Governing the Internal Audit Function. • Domain IV: Managing the Internal Audit Function. • Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICABILITY AND ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS/● Principles Description ● Standards Practices ● Evidence Proof/Domains II through V contain the following elements: • Principles: broad descriptions of a related group of requirements and considerations. • Standards, which include:     – Requirements: mandatory practices for internal auditing.     – Considerations for Implementation: common and preferred practices to consider when implementing the requirements.     – Examples of Evidence of Conformance: ways to demonstrate that the requirements of the Standards have been implemented
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICABILITY AND ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARDS/● "Must," "Should," "May" ● Evidence Examples ● Glossary Terms/The Standards use the word “must” in the Requirements sections and the words “should” and “may” to specify common and preferred practices in the Considerations for Implementation sections.  Each standard ends with a list of examples of evidence.  The examples are neither requirements nor the only ways to demonstrate conformance; rather, they are provided to help internal audit functions prepare for quality assessments, which rely on demonstrative evidence.  The Standards use certain terms as defined in the accompanying glossary.  To understand and implement the Standards correctly, it is necessary to understand and adopt the specific meanings and usage of the terms as described in the glossary.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / DEMONSTRATING CONFORMANCE WITH THE STANDARDS/● Aids Conformance ● Achieve Intent ● Resource Limits ● Alternative Actions ● Document Deviation ● Standard 4.1, Domain III ● Common Questions/The requirements, considerations for implementation, and examples of evidence of conformance are designed to help internal auditors conform with the Standards.  While conformance with the requirements is expected, internal auditors occasionally may be unable to conform with a requirement yet still achieve the intent of the standard.  Circumstances that may necessitate adjustments are often related to resource limitations or specific aspects of a sector, industry, and/or jurisdiction.  In these exceptional circumstances, alternative actions should be implemented to meet the intent of the related standard.  The chief audit executive is responsible for documenting and conveying the rationale for the deviation and the adopted alternative actions to the appropriate parties.  Related requirements and information appear in Standard 4.1 Conformance with Global Internal Audit Standards and Domain III: Governing the Internal Audit Function together with its principles and standards.  While the circumstances necessitating adjustments are too varied to list, the following section acknowledges two areas that consistently draw questions: small internal audit functions and those in the public sector.
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / APPLICATION IN SMALL INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTIONS/● IA Size Matters ● Limited Resources ● Need External Help/The internal audit function’s ability to fully conform with the Standards may be affected by its size or the size of the organization.  With limited resources, completing certain tasks may be challenging.  Additionally, if the internal audit function comprises only one member, an adequate quality assurance and improvement program will require assistance from outside the internal audit function. (See also Standards 10.1 Financial Resource Management, 12.1 Internal Quality Assessment, and 12.3 Oversee and Improve Engagement Performance.)
GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS  / FUNDAMENTALS OF THE  APPLICATION IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR/● Unique Situations ● Government Specifics ● Terminology Differences ● Standard Application/While the Global Internal Audit Standards apply to all internal audit functions, internal auditors in the public sector work in a political environment under governance, organizational, and funding structures that may differ from those of the private sector.  The nature of these structures and related conditions may be affected by the jurisdiction and level of government in which the internal audit function operates.  Additionally, some terminology used in the public sector differs from that of the private sector.  These differences may affect how internal audit functions in the public sector apply the Standards.  The section “Applying the Global Internal Audit Standards in the Public Sector,” which follows Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services, describes strategies for conformance amid the circumstances and conditions unique to internal auditing in the public sector.
 DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING  / PURPOSE STATEMENT/● Helps understand ● Helps explain/The purpose statement is intended to assist internal auditors and internal audit stakeholders in understanding and articulating the value of internal auditing.
 DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING  / PURPOSE STATEMENT/● Strengthens Value ● Independent Assurance ● Advice & Insight/Internal auditing strengthens the organization’s ability to create, protect, and sustain value by providing the board and management with independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.
 DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING  / PURPOSE STATEMENT/● Achieve Objectives ● Strengthen Processes ● Support Decisions/Internal auditing enhances the organization’s:  • Successful achievement of its objectives.  • Governance, risk management, and control processes.  • Decision-making and oversight.  • Reputation and credibility with its stakeholders.  • Ability to serve the public interest.
 DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING  / PURPOSE STATEMENT/● Competent Professionals ● Independent Function ● Objective Assessments/Internal auditing is most effective when:  • It is performed by competent professionals in conformance with the Global Internal Audit Standards, which are set in the public interest.  • The internal audit function is independently positioned with direct accountability to the board.  • Internal auditors are free from undue influence and committed to making objective assessments.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM /  DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Ethics Standards ● Builds Trust/**The principles and standards** in the Ethics and Professionalism domain of the Global Internal Audit Standards replace The IIA’s former Code of Ethics and outline the behavioral expectations for professional internal auditors; including chief audit executives, other individuals, and any entities that provide internal audit services.  Conformance with these principles and standards instills trust in the profession of internal auditing, creates an ethical culture within the internal audit function, and provides the basis for reliance on internal auditors’ work and judgment.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM /  DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Follow Standards ● Other Codes ● Not Exhaustive/All internal auditors are required to conform with the standards of ethics and professionalism.  If internal auditors are expected to abide by other codes of ethics, behavior, or conduct, such as those of an organization, conformance with the principles and standards of ethics and professionalism contained herein is still expected.  The fact that a particular behavior is not mentioned in these principles and standards does not preclude it from being considered unacceptable or discreditable.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM /  DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Auditor Responsibility ● CAE Delegation/While internal auditors are responsible for their own conformance, the chief audit executive is expected to support and promote conformance with the principles and standards in the Ethics and Professionalism domain by providing opportunities for training and guidance.  The chief audit executive may choose to delegate certain responsibilities for managing conformance but retains accountability for the ethics and professionalism of the internal audit function.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY/● Show Integrity/**Internal auditors demonstrate integrity in their work and behavior.**
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY/● Moral principles ● Truth & Ethics/Integrity is behavior characterized by adherence to moral and ethical principles, including demonstrating honesty and the courage to act based on relevant facts, even when facing pressure to do otherwise, or when doing so might create potential adverse personal or organizational consequences.  In simple terms, internal auditors are expected to tell the truth and do the right thing, even when it is uncomfortable or difficult.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY/● Ethical Basis ● Build Trust/Integrity is the foundation of the other principles of ethics and professionalism, including objectivity, competency, due professional care, and confidentiality.  The integrity of internal auditors is essential to establishing trust and earning respect.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Honesty Required ● Courage Needed/Internal auditors must perform their work with honesty and professional courage.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Truthful Communication ● Avoid Misleading ● Disclose Facts/Internal auditors must be truthful, accurate, clear, open, and respectful in all professional relationships and communications, even when expressing skepticism or offering an opposing viewpoint.  Internal auditors must not make false, misleading, or deceptive statements, nor conceal or omit findings or other pertinent information from communications.  Internal auditors must disclose all material facts known to them that, if not disclosed, could affect the organization’s ability to make well-informed decisions.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Courage Needed/Internal auditors must exhibit professional courage by communicating truthfully and taking appropriate action, even when confronted by dilemmas and difficult situations.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Supportive Workplace ● Fact●Based Results ● Findings Matter/The chief audit executive must maintain a work environment where internal auditors feel supported when expressing legitimate, evidence-based engagement results, whether favorable or unfavorable.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ethics Training ● Workplace Practice ● Supervisor Discussion/Internal auditors should enhance their awareness and understanding of honesty and professional courage by seeking opportunities to obtain ethics-related continuing professional education.  While education helps create awareness in hypothetical situations, workplace training, mentorship, and supervision allow internal auditors to learn and practice skills such as tact and respectful communication, which are needed to apply professional courage effectively in real situations.  When internal auditors encounter situations that challenge their honesty or professional courage, they should discuss the circumstances with a supervisor to determine the best course of action.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ethical Training ● Engagement Supervision ● Guidance Honesty ● Stakeholder Feedback/To support internal auditors, the chief audit executive should arrange opportunities for education and training as well as discussions of hypothetical and real situations that require making ethical choices.  Effective management of the internal audit function includes proper engagement supervision and periodic reviews of internal auditors’ performance.  For example, when approving work programs or reviewing engagement workpapers, an engagement supervisor may provide appropriate guidance to help internal auditors address potential or encountered situations that could pose a threat to their honesty and integrity.  As part of evaluating internal auditors’ performance, the chief audit executive may solicit feedback about their honesty and professional courage from the stakeholders with whom internal auditors interact.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.1 HONESTY AND PROFESSIONAL COURAGE  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Ethics Training ● Training Records ● Performance Goals ● Stakeholder Feedback/• A training plan that includes ethics education and training.  • Documents that evidence internal auditors’ attendance or participation in ethics education and training.  • Performance evaluations showing honesty and professional courage as objectives.  • Feedback from key stakeholders regarding the honesty and courage of internal auditors.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / REQUIREMENTS/● Know Ethics ● Spot Violations/Internal auditors must understand, respect, meet, and contribute to the legitimate and ethical expectations of the organization and must be able to recognize conduct that is contrary to those expectations.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / REQUIREMENTS/● Promote Ethics ● Report Violations/Internal auditors must encourage and promote an ethics-based culture in the organization.  If internal auditors identify behavior within the organization that is inconsistent with the organization’s ethical expectations, they must report the concern according to applicable policies and procedures.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ethics Documents ● Policies & Culture/An organization’s ethical expectations usually are documented in a code of ethics, code of conduct, and/ or policies related to professional behavior and ethical conduct.  Such policies, along with the organization’s objectives and processes for promoting its ethics and values, provide the basis for an ethical culture.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ethics Risk ● Policy Communication ● CAE Methodology/The internal audit plan may include assessments of the organization’s ethics-related risks to determine whether existing policies and control processes adequately and effectively address those risks.  For example, the organization’s policies may specify the criteria and process for handling and communicating about ethics-related issues, the parties that should receive the communication, and the protocol for escalating unresolved issues.  The chief audit executive also should determine a methodology for addressing ethical issues and discuss the methodology with the board and senior management to ensure alignment of the approaches.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ethics Risks ● Report Violations/Internal auditors should consider ethics-related risks and controls during individual engagements.  If internal auditors identify behavior within the organization that is inconsistent with the organization’s ethical expectations, they should communicate the concerns according to the methodology established by the chief audit executive, which takes into account the organization’s policies and processes as well as laws and/or regulations.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Senior Management ● Board Chairman ● Issue Follow●Up/If internal auditors determine that a member of senior management has behaved in a manner that is inconsistent with the organization’s ethical expectations — whether documented in a code of conduct, code of ethics, or otherwise — the chief audit executive should report the violation to the board.  If an ethics-related concern involves the chairman of the board, the chief audit executive should report the concern to the entire board.  Internal auditors should follow up on ethics-related issues involving the board or senior management and validate that appropriate actions were taken to address the concern.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 1 DEMONSTRATE INTEGRITY  / STANDARD 1.2 ORGANIZATION’S ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Ethics Training ● Signed Forms ● Audit Consideration ● Issue Reporting/• Records of internal auditors’ participation in workshops, training events, or meetings where ethical expectations and issues were discussed.  • Forms signed by individual internal auditors acknowledging their understanding of and commitment to follow ethics policies and procedures of the organization.  • The internal audit plan, work program, or workpapers showing consideration of the organization’s ethics-related objectives, risks, and control processes.  • Documentation demonstrating that ethical issues were communicated to the board, senior management, and regulators in accordance with the organization’s policies and relevant laws and/or regulations.

 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Purpose & Services ● Audit Foundation ● Consider Stakeholders ● Stakeholder Interests/To perform services with due professional care requires that internal auditors consider and understand the Purpose of Internal Auditing and the nature of the internal audit services to be provided.  Internal auditors should start by understanding the internal audit charter, the internal audit plan, and the factors that help determine which engagements are included in the plan.  When planning and performing internal audit services, internal auditors also consider the interests of the organization’s customers and other stakeholders (including the public) affected by the organization’s actions.  Such interests include stakeholders’ expectations (such as fair and honest business practices), needs (such as safety), and potential exposure to underlying risks that may not be obviously related to the organization’s strategy and objectives.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Risk Assessment ● Org. Factors/The considerations in due professional care comprise the circumstances and aspects of risk that the chief audit executive must consider when performing the risk assessment on which the internal audit plan is based.  Relevant circumstances include the organization’s strategy and objectives and the adequacy and effectiveness of the organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Audit Planning ● Risk Relativity ● Scope Significance/Additionally, internal auditors consider these circumstances relative to an activity under review during engagement planning, as described in Domain V: Performing Internal Audit Services.  The complexity, materiality, and significance of risks being evaluated is relative.  A risk may not be material or significant to the organization but may be material or significant in an engagement or to an activity under review.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Understand context ● Prioritize risks/Thus, understanding the complexity, materiality, and significance in context is necessary to properly assess relevant risks and determine which risks should be prioritized for further evaluation.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Balance Costs ● Poor Controls ● Maximize Value ● Efficient Planning ● Use Technology/Due professional care also requires weighing the costs (such as resource requirements) of the internal audit services against the benefits that may result.  For example, if the controls in an activity under review are not adequately designed, the benefits of fully evaluating the effectiveness of those controls are not likely to be worth the costs.  Internal auditors seek to provide the most value or benefit for the organization’s investment in internal audit services.  Additionally, thorough planning requires internal auditors to consider the techniques, tools, technology, and extent and timeliness of work needed to achieve the engagement objectives most efficiently.  Internal auditors, especially the chief audit executive, should consider the use of data analysis software and other technology that support the review and evaluation processes.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.2 DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Engagement Supervision ● Quality Program/Proper engagement supervision and a quality assurance and improvement program promote due professional care.

 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.3 PROFESSIONAL SKEPTICISM  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Unbiased Judgments ● Question Truthfulness ● Seek Proof ● Deep Exploration/Professional skepticism enables internal auditors to make objective judgments based on facts, information, and logic, rather than trust or belief.  Skepticism is the attitude of always questioning or doubting the validity and truthfulness of claims, statements, and other information.  Internal auditors apply professional skepticism when they seek evidence to support and validate statements made by management, rather than simply trusting the information presented as true or genuine without question or doubt.  Professional skepticism requires curiosity and the willingness to explore beyond the surface level of a given topic.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.3 PROFESSIONAL SKEPTICISM  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Skepticism Information Quality ● Incorrect Info Analysis ● Validation & Review/When gathering and analyzing information, internal auditors should apply professional skepticism to determine whether information is relevant, reliable, and sufficient.  If internal auditors determine that information is incomplete, inconsistent, false, or misleading, they should perform additional analyses to identify the correct and complete information needed to support engagement results.  Additional validation is provided by the review and approval of workpapers and/or engagement communications by the chief audit executive or a designated engagement supervisor.
 DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM  / PRINCIPLE 4 EXERCISE DUE PROFESSIONAL CARE  / STANDARD 4.3 PROFESSIONAL SKEPTICISM  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Audit Executives ● Training Opportunities ● Recognize Information/Chief audit executives should help internal auditors build their competency related to professional skepticism.

 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 6 AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD  / STANDARD 6.3 BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Regular Updates ● Agreed Information/The chief audit executive should also have other interactions with the board between official meetings to keep the board apprised of the internal audit function’s progress.  The types of information and the level of detail to be communicated by the chief audit executive to the board should be agreed upon by both parties.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 6 AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD  / STANDARD 6.3 BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● CAE Reporting ● Report to CEO/As discussed in Standard 7.1 Organizational Independence, it is important that the chief audit executive report administratively to an individual in the organization who can support the internal audit function’s pursuit of the internal audit mandate.  A leading practice is for the chief audit executive to report to the chief executive officer or equivalent.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 6 AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD  / STANDARD 6.3 BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Private Meetings ● Inform Management ● Exception Reporting/While it is critical for the chief audit executive to meet privately with the board, the chief audit executive should inform senior management of such discussions, unless doing so is inappropriate (for example, if a private conversation relates to an impropriety by a member of senior management).
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 6 AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD  / STANDARD 6.3 BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● CAE Collaboration ● Board Oversight/The chief audit executive should work with senior management to understand each other’s reporting requirements to the board to help enable timely, clear, and transparent reporting that is not redundant or conflicting.  This helps the board exercise its oversight responsibilities and enables a collaborative working relationship between the chief audit executive and senior management.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 6 AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD  / STANDARD 6.3 BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Budget Approval ● CAE Judgement/The board’s approval of the internal audit budget and resource plan is important as these demonstrate that the internal audit function has the resources necessary to complete its planned audit activities.

 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY/● Board Oversight ● Unbiased Audits ● CAE Reporting/The board is responsible for enabling the independence of the internal audit function.  Independence is defined as the freedom from conditions that impair the internal audit function’s ability to carry out its responsibilities in an unbiased manner.  The internal audit function is only able to fulfill the Purpose of Internal Auditing when the chief audit executive reports directly to the board, is qualified, and is positioned at a level within the organization that enables the internal audit function to discharge its services and responsibilities without interference.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE Confirmation ● Report Impairments/The chief audit executive must confirm to the board the organizational independence of the internal audit function at least annually.

(See also Standard 6.2 Internal Audit Charter.)
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE Discussion ● CAE Safeguards/The chief audit executive must discuss with the board and senior management any current or proposed roles and responsibilities that have the potential to impair the internal audit function’s independence, either in fact or appearance.  The chief audit executive must advise the board and senior management of the types of safeguards to manage actual, potential, or perceived impairments.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE other roles ● Alternative assurance ● External provider/When the chief audit executive has one or more ongoing roles beyond internal auditing, the responsibilities, nature of work, and established safeguards must be documented in the internal audit charter.  If those areas of responsibility are subject to internal auditing, alternative processes to obtain assurance must be established, such as contracting with an objective, competent external assurance provider that reports independently to the board.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Temporary Nonaudit ● Transition Plan/When the chief audit executive’s nonaudit responsibilities are temporary, assurance for those areas must be provided by an independent third party during the temporary assignment and for the subsequent 12 months.  Also, the chief audit executive must establish a plan to transition those responsibilities to management.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Governance Limits ● Document Limitations ● Employ Safeguards/If the governing structure does not support organizational independence, the chief audit executive must document the characteristics of the governing structure limiting independence and any safeguards that may be employed to achieve this principle.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Reporting Line ● CAE Approval ● Performance Input ● Private Discussion ● High Position ● Recognize Impairments ● Implement Safeguards ● Prevent Interference/Essential Conditions  **Board** • Establish a direct reporting relationship with the chief audit executive and the internal audit function to enable the internal audit function to fulfill its mandate.  • Authorize the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive.  • Provide input to senior management to support the performance evaluation and remuneration of the chief audit executive.  • Provide the chief audit executive with opportunities to discuss significant and sensitive matters with the board, including meetings without senior management present.  • Require that the chief audit executive be positioned at a level in the organization that enables internal audit services and responsibilities to be performed without interference from management.  • This positioning provides the organizational authority and status to bring matters directly to senior management and escalate matters to the board when necessary.  • Acknowledge the actual or potential impairments to the internal audit function’s independence when approving roles or responsibilities for the chief audit executive that are beyond the scope of internal auditing.  • Engage with senior management and the chief audit executive to establish appropriate safeguards if chief audit executive roles and responsibilities impair or appear to impair the internal audit function’s independence.  • Engage with senior management to ensure that the internal audit function is free from interference when determining its scope, performing internal audit engagements, and communicating results.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Position Audit ● CAE Reporting ● Mitigate Threats ● CAE Hiring ● CAE Performance/Essential Conditions  **Senior Management**  • Position the internal audit function at a level within the organization that enables it to perform its services and responsibilities without interference, as directed by the board.  • Recognize the chief audit executive’s direct reporting relationship with the board.  • Engage with the board and the chief audit executive to understand any potential impairments to the internal audit function’s independence caused by nonaudit roles or other circumstances and support the implementation of appropriate safeguards to manage such impairments.  • Provide input to the board on the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive.  • Solicit input from the board on the performance evaluation and remuneration of the chief audit executive.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Report to Board ● Direct Reporting Enables ● Examples Interference ● Examples Limitation/Internal auditing is most effective when the internal audit function is directly accountable to the board (also known as “functionally reporting to the board”), rather than directly accountable to management for the activities over which it provides assurance and advice.  A direct reporting relationship between the board and the chief audit executive enables the internal audit function to perform internal audit services and communicate engagement results without interference or undue limitations.  Examples of interference include management failing to provide requested information in a timely manner and restricting access to information, personnel, or physical properties.  Limiting budgets or resources in a way that interferes with the internal audit function’s ability to operate effectively is an example of undue limitation. (See also Standard 11.3 Communicating Results.)
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Dual Reporting ● Challenge Authority ● CEO Reporting ● Direct Communication/While the chief audit executive reports functionally to the board, the administrative reporting relationship is often to a member of management.  This enables access to senior management and the authority to challenge management’s perspectives.  To achieve this authority, it is leading practice for the chief audit executive to report administratively to the chief executive officer or equivalent, although reporting to another senior officer may achieve the same objective if appropriate safeguards are implemented.  Subsidiary, branch, and divisional heads of the internal audit function should be able to communicate directly with the senior management responsible for those areas.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● CAE evaluation ● Resolve issues/When evaluating whether independence is impaired, the chief audit executive should consider reporting relationships, roles, and responsibilities to determine whether actual, potential, or perceived impairments exist.  Additionally, through discussions with the concerned parties, the chief audit executive may be able to resolve any situations of perceived impairments that do not in fact affect the internal audit function’s ability to perform its responsibilities independently.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● No board contact ● Scope limitation ● Restricted access ● Findings pressure ● Budget reduction ● CAE responsibility ● Reporting conflict/Situations that may introduce impairments to independence include:  • The chief audit executive lacks direct communication or interaction with the board.  • Management attempts to limit the scope of the internal audit services that were previously approved by the board and documented in the internal audit charter.  • Management attempts to restrict access to the data, records, information, personnel, and physical properties required to perform the internal audit services.  • Management pressures internal auditors to suppress or change internal audit findings.  • The budget for the internal audit function is reduced to a level that leaves the function unable to fulfill its responsibilities as outlined in the internal audit charter.  • An assurance engagement is performed by the internal audit function or supervised by the chief audit executive in a functional area for which the chief audit executive is responsible, has oversight, or is otherwise able to exert significant influence.  • The internal audit function performs, or the chief audit executive supervises, assurance services related to an activity that is managed by a senior executive (non-CEO) to which the chief audit executive reports administratively.  • For example, the chief audit executive reports to the chief financial officer and is responsible for auditing treasury, a function that also reports to the chief financial officer.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● CAE Roles ● New Regulations ● Limited Resources/In addition to the responsibilities of managing the internal audit function, the chief audit executive is sometimes asked to take on nonaudit roles that may impair or appear to impair the internal audit function’s independence.  Examples include situations such as: • A new regulatory requirement prompts an immediate need to develop controls and other risk management activities to ensure compliance.  • The chief audit executive has the most appropriate expertise to adapt existing risk management activities to a new business segment or geographic market.  • The organization’s resources are too constrained or the organization is too small to afford a separate compliance function.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Discuss Nonaudit Roles ● Permanent vs Temporary ● Transfer to Management/When discussing nonaudit roles and responsibilities with the board and senior management, the chief audit executive should identify appropriate safeguards depending on whether the roles are permanent or temporary and intended to be transferred to management.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Mitigate Risks ● Transition Timeline/When the board agrees that an impairment has occurred, the chief audit executive should suggest to the board and senior management potential safeguards to manage the risks.  It is also important to specify a timeline for transitioning temporary nonaudit responsibilities to management.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Independent Review ● Bias Perception ● Discuss Period/The requirement is to have assurance activities overseen by an independent third party for the subsequent 12 months after the chief audit executive completes temporary responsibilities in that area.  However, judgment should be used as there may be circumstances whereby the perception of impairment may exist beyond 12 months.  The chief audit executive should discuss with the board and senior management whether 12 months is appropriate or not.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Disclose Impairments ● Independence Problem/To determine the other parties to which disclosure of existing impairments must be made, the chief audit executive should consider the nature of the impairment, the impairment’s impact on the reliability of the results of internal audit services, and the expectations of relevant stakeholders.  If a potential impairment of the internal audit function’s independence is discovered after an engagement has been completed that may affect the reliability or perceived reliability of the engagement findings, recommendations, and/or conclusions, the chief audit executive should discuss the concern with the management of the activity under review, the board, senior management, and/or other affected stakeholders and determine the appropriate actions to resolve the situation. (See also Standards 2.3 Disclosing Impairments to Objectivity and 11.4 Errors and Omissions.)
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Board Involvement ● Discuss Qualifications ● Review Candidates/Before a chief audit executive is hired, the board should be involved in the recruitment and appointment process.  For example, the board may discuss the qualifications and competencies necessary to lead the internal audit function and perform any additional roles and responsibilities expected by the organization.  Additionally, the board should consider reviewing candidates’ résumés and participating in interviews before a candidate is selected.
 DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 7 POSITIONED INDEPENDENTLY  / STANDARD 7.1 ORGANIZATIONAL INDEPENDENCE  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Charter Reporting ● Meeting Communication ● Board Confirmation ● Charter Nonaudit ● Documented Methods ● Formal Plans ● Assurance Services ● Board Approval/• The internal audit charter, which documents the internal audit function’s reporting relationships.  • Meeting minutes or other evidence of the chief audit executive’s direct communication with the board and senior management regarding potential impairments to independence and planned safeguards.  • Board meeting minutes or other documentation showing that the chief audit executive confirmed with the board the ongoing independence of the internal audit function or discussed impairments affecting the internal audit function’s ability to fulfill its mandate and the safeguards to manage the impairments.  • The internal audit charter documenting board approval of long-term nonaudit roles and responsibilities and corresponding safeguards to independence, including the expected duration of the roles, responsibilities, and safeguards and how the effectiveness of the safeguards will be evaluated periodically.  • Documented methodologies to be followed when an impairment is suspected or identified.  • Formal action plans that outline specific safeguards to address independence concerns.  • Documentation of assurance services to be provided by other internal or external providers as a safeguard to independence.  • Minutes or other documentation evidencing the board’s approval of the appointment or removal of the chief audit executive.

 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.2 INTERNAL AUDIT STRATEGY  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Strategy changes ● Org Changes ● Rule Changes ● Leadership changes ● Audit results/The internal audit strategy should be adjusted whenever changes occur in the organization’s strategic objectives or stakeholders’ expectations.  Factors that may prompt a more frequent review of the internal audit strategy include:  • Changes in the organization’s strategy or the maturity of its governance, risk management, and control processes.  • Changes in the organization’s policies and procedures or the laws and/or regulations to which the organization is subject.  • Changes in members of the board, senior management, or the chief audit executive.  • Results of internal and external assessments of the internal audit function.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.2 INTERNAL AUDIT STRATEGY  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Strategy Timeline ● Strategy Review/The chief audit executive may design a timeline for implementation of the internal audit strategy and related performance measures. (See also Standard 12.2 Performance Measurement.)   A periodic review of the internal audit strategy should include a discussion of the internal audit function’s progress on initiatives with the board and senior management.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.2 INTERNAL AUDIT STRATEGY  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Strategy Document ● Meeting Records ● Data Analysis ● Audit Methods ● Progress Checks/• Documented internal audit strategy, including vision, strategic objectives, and supporting initiatives.  • Minutes or correspondence from meetings with the board, senior management, and/or other stakeholders where expectations were discussed.  • Notes showing the information and analyses that informed the strategy.  • Internal audit methodologies for producing and reviewing the internal audit strategy and monitoring its implementation.  • Results of periodic self-assessments or other reviews of the progress on initiatives.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.3 METHODOLOGIES  / REQUIREMENTS/● Establish Methodologies ● Evaluate, Update ● Auditor Training/The chief audit executive must establish methodologies to guide the internal audit function in a systematic and disciplined manner to implement the internal audit strategy, develop the internal audit plan, and conform with the Standards.  The chief audit executive must evaluate the effectiveness of the methodologies and update them as necessary to improve the internal audit function and respond to significant changes that affect the function.  The chief audit executive must provide internal auditors with training on the methodologies. (See also Principles 13 Plan Engagements Effectively, 14 Conduct Engagement Work, and 15 Communicate Engagement Results and Monitor Action Plans, and their standards.)
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.3 METHODOLOGIES  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Methodology Variance ● Document Types ● Standard Implementation ● Function Management/The form, content, level of detail, and degree of documentation of methodologies may differ based on the size, structure, complexity, industry/regulatory expectations, and maturity of the organization and the internal audit function.  Methodologies may exist as individual documents (such as standard operating procedures) or may be collected into an internal audit manual or integrated into internal audit management software.  Internal audit methodologies supplement the Standards by providing specific instructions and criteria that help internal auditors implement the Standards and perform services with quality.  Additionally, internal audit methodologies describe processes and procedures for communicating, handling operational and administrative matters, and overseeing the internal audit function.  (See also Standards 14.3 Evaluation of Findings, 14.5 Engagement Conclusions, and 15.2 Confirming the Implementation of Recommendations or Action Plans.)
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.3 METHODOLOGIES  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Risk Assessments ● Audit Planning ● Assurance vs Advisory ● Coordinate Assurance ● Manage Providers ● Audit Engagements ● Communication Plan ● Records Retention ● Monitor Implementation ● Quality Assurance ● Performance Measurement ● Additional Services/Documented methodologies that are most likely to be necessary to implement the strategy, achieve the internal audit plan, and conform with Standards include the internal audit function’s approach to:  • Assessing risks for the organization and for each engagement.  • Developing and updating the internal audit plan.  • Determining the balance between assurance and advisory engagements.  • Coordinating with internal and external assurance providers.  • Managing external service providers, when used.  • Performing internal audit engagements.  • Communicating throughout internal audit services.  • Retaining and releasing engagement records and other information, consistent with the organization’s guidelines and pertinent regulatory or other requirements.  • Monitoring and confirming the implementation of internal auditors’ recommendations or management’s action plans.  • Assuring the quality and improvement of the internal audit function.  • Developing performance measurements to assess progress toward meeting objectives.  • Performing additional services identified in the internal audit mandate.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.3 METHODOLOGIES  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Review Effectiveness ● Update Reasons ● Leadership Changes/The effectiveness of the internal audit methodologies should be reviewed during assessments of the internal audit function’s quality.  Reasons for updating established methodologies include significant changes in professional internal audit standards and guidance, legal and/or regulatory requirements, technology, and department size or composition.  A change of the chief audit executive or board chairman may also warrant the review and revision of internal audit methodologies.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.3 METHODOLOGIES  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Software Record ● Communication Proof ● Quality Checks ● Standard Citations ● Update Records/• Documentation of software program incorporating methodologies.  • Meeting agendas and minutes, emails, signed acknowledgments, training schedules, or similar documentation evidencing communications to internal audit personnel about internal audit methodologies.  • Documentation of quality reviews of audit work demonstrating that methodologies are followed.  • Footnotes or endnotes within the methodologies or internal audit manual citing the standard that the content is addressing.  • Documentation of updates to the methodologies.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE Develops ● Plan Achieves/The chief audit executive must create an internal audit plan that supports the achievement of the organization’s objectives.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / REQUIREMENTS/● Audit Plan ● Input Needed ● Annual Assessment/The chief audit executive must base the internal audit plan on a documented assessment of the organization’s strategies, objectives, and risks.  This assessment must be informed by input from the board and senior management as well as the chief audit executive’s understanding of the organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes.  The assessment must be performed at least annually.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / REQUIREMENTS/● Audit Coverage ● Improve Governance ● Address Risks ● Resource Needs ● Dynamic Updates/The internal audit plan must:  • Consider the internal audit mandate and the full range of agreed-to internal audit services.  • Specify internal audit services that support the evaluation and improvement of the organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes.  • Consider coverage of information technology governance, fraud risk, the effectiveness of the organization’s compliance and ethics programs, and other high-risk areas.  • Identify the necessary human, financial, and technological resources necessary to complete the plan.  • Be dynamic and updated timely in response to changes in the organization’s business, risks operations, programs, systems, controls, and organizational culture.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / REQUIREMENTS/● Revise & Inform ● Resource Impact ● High Risk Exclusion ● Conflicting Demands ● Scope Restrictions/The chief audit executive must review and revise the internal audit plan as necessary and communicate timely to the board and senior management:  • The impact of any resource limitations on internal audit coverage.  • The rationale for not including an assurance engagement in a high-risk area or activity in the plan.  • Conflicting demands for services between major stakeholders, such as high-priority requests based on emerging risks and requests to replace planned assurance engagements with advisory engagements.  • Limitations on scope or restrictions on access to information.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE Discussion ● Board Approval/The chief audit executive must discuss the internal audit plan, including significant interim changes, with the board and senior management.  The plan and significant changes to the plan must be approved by the board.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Annual Risk ● Continuous Updates ● Update Frequency ● Consider Changes/This standard requires an organizationwide risk assessment to be completed at least annually as the basis for the plan.  However, the chief audit executive should keep continuously apprised of risk information, updating the risk assessment and internal audit plan accordingly.  If the organization’s environment is dynamic, the internal audit plan may need to be updated as frequently as every six months, quarterly, or even monthly.  The size, complexity, and type of changes occurring in the organization relative to the maturity of the organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes should be considered when determining the appropriate level of effort to update the risk assessment.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Organize Auditable Areas ● Goals and Structure ● Units as Auditable ● Link to Risks ● Prioritize Risks/One approach to preparing the internal audit plan is to organize potentially auditable units within the organization into an audit universe to facilitate the identification and assessment of risks.  An audit universe is most useful when it is based on an understanding of the organization’s objectives and strategic initiatives and aligned with the organization’s structure or risk framework.  Auditable units may include business units, processes, programs, and systems.  The chief audit executive can link those organizational units to key risks in preparation for a comprehensive risk assessment and the identification of assurance coverage throughout the organization.  This process enables the chief audit executive to prioritize the risks to be evaluated further during internal audit engagements.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Validate Key Risks ● Rely on Management?/To strive to ensure that the audit universe and risk assessment cover the organization’s key risks, the internal audit function should independently review and validate the key risks that were identified within the organization’s risk management system.  The internal audit function should only rely on management’s information about risks if it has concluded that the organization’s risk management processes are effective.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Unit●Level Objectives ● Cross●Unit Risks/To complete the organizationwide risk assessment, the chief audit executive should consider objectives and strategies not just at the broad organizational level but also at the level of specific auditable units.  Additionally, the chief audit executive should give due consideration to risks — such as those related to ethics, fraud, information technology, third-party relationships, and noncompliance with regulatory requirements — that may be tied to more than one business unit or process and may require more complex evaluation.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Gather Information ● Continuous Assessment ● Include Opportunities/To support this risk assessment, the chief audit executive may gather information from recently completed internal audit engagements as well as discussions with members of the board and senior management. (See also Standards 9.1 Understanding Governance, Risk Management, and Control Processes and 11.3 Communicating Results.)   The chief audit executive may implement a methodology for continuously assessing risks.  Risks should be considered not only in terms of negative effects and barriers to achieving objectives but also in terms of opportunities that enhance the organization’s ability to achieve its objectives.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Identify risks ● Limited resources ● Rely on sources/The chief audit executive should develop a process to identify and assess significant, new, and emerging risks that should be considered for coverage in the audit plan.  For example, resource limitations may make it impossible for the internal audit function to assess every risk in the audit universe annually.  In such cases, the chief audit executive may need to increase reliance on sources of risk information such as management’s risk assessments, meetings with the board and senior management, and the results of previous engagements and other audit work.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Risk & Controls ● Influencing Factors ● Reevaluate Reliance/To create the internal audit plan, the chief audit executive considers the level of risk identified across each of the auditable units relative to the known level of control effectiveness.  Also influencing the internal audit plan are requests made by the board and senior management, the assurance coverage expected throughout the organization, engagements required by laws or regulations, and the internal audit function’s ability to rely on the work of other assurance providers.  The chief audit executive should plan to reevaluate reliance periodically.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Legal Requirements ● Critical Engagements ● Significant Risks ● Assurance Coverage ● Advisory Requests ● Resource Needs ● Potential Benefits/When developing the internal audit plan, the chief audit executive should consider the following: • Engagements required by laws or regulations.  • Engagements critical to the organization’s mission or strategy.  • Areas and activities with significant levels of risk.  • Whether all significant risks have sufficient coverage by assurance providers.  • Advisory and ad hoc requests.  • The time and resources required for each potential engagement.  • Each engagement’s potential benefits to the organization, such as the engagement’s potential to contribute to the improvement of the organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Operational Priorities ● External Audits ● Auditor Skills ● Activity Access/To schedule internal audit engagements, the chief audit executive should consider: • The organization’s operational priorities.  • Schedule of external audit engagements and regulatory reviews.  • Competencies and availability of internal auditors.  • Ability to access the activity under review.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Resource Allocation ● Engagement Details ● Engagement Rationale ● Engagement Scope ● Contingency Buffer ● Additional Engagements/The proposed internal audit plan should include: • The resources and hours available for engagements compared to other administrative and nonaudit activities or initiatives focused on improving the internal audit function.  • The list of proposed engagements and related analysis, specifying the degree to which the engagements are:      – Assurance or advisory.      – Focused on certain departments, units, or objectives of the organization.      – Predominately addressing financial, compliance, operational, cybersecurity, or other objectives.  • The rationale for selecting each proposed engagement; for example, significance of risk, organizational theme or trend (root cause), regulatory requirement, or time since last engagement.  • General purpose and preliminary scope of each proposed engagement.  • A percentage of hours to be reserved for contingencies and ad hoc requests.  • The next set of engagements that would have been performed if additional resources were available. Discussion regarding these engagements may help the board assess the adequacy of resources available to the internal audit function.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Agree Criteria ● Document Criteria ● Significant Changes ● Urgent Changes/The chief audit executive, the board, and senior management should agree upon the criteria that define the significant changes that require a revision of the audit plan.  The agreed-upon criteria and protocol should be incorporated into the internal audit function’s methodologies.  Examples of significant changes include canceling or postponing engagements related to significant risks or critical strategic objectives.  If risks arise that necessitate revisions to the plan before a formal discussion with the board can be scheduled, the board should be informed of the changes immediately, and a formal approval should occur as soon as possible.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.4 INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Approved Plan ● Risk Assessment ● Meeting Minutes ● Discussion Notes ● Distribution List ● Documented Methods/• Approved internal audit plan.  • Documented risk assessment and prioritization, including the inputs upon which the plan is based.  • Minutes of meetings in which the chief audit executive discussed with the board and senior management the audit universe, organizationwide risk assessment, internal audit plan, and the criteria and protocol for handling significant changes to the plan.  • Notes documenting discussions to gather information to inform the organizationwide risk assessment and internal audit plan.  • Documented list of those to whom the internal audit plan was distributed.  • Documented methodologies for organizationwide risk assessment and protocol for handling significant changes.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE Coordination ● Avoid Duplication/The chief audit executive must coordinate with internal and external providers of assurance services and consider relying upon their work.  Coordination of services minimizes duplication of efforts, highlights gaps in coverage of key risks, and enhances the overall value added by providers.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● CAE informs ● Escalate to board/If unable to achieve an appropriate level of coordination, the chief audit executive must raise any concerns with senior management and, if necessary, the board.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / REQUIREMENTS/● Document Reliance ● IA Responsibility/When the internal audit function relies on the work of other assurance service providers, the chief audit executive must document the basis for that reliance and is still responsible for the conclusions reached by the internal audit function.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Evaluate Providers ● Assess Provider ● Understand Work/The chief audit executive should develop a methodology for evaluating other providers of assurance and advisory services that includes a basis for relying upon their work.  The evaluation should consider the providers’ roles, responsibilities, organizational independence, competency, and objectivity, as well as the due professional care applied to their work.  The chief audit executive should understand the objectives, scope, and results of the work performed.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● CAE identifies providers ● Internal assurance ● External assurance/The chief audit executive should identify the organization’s assurance and advisory service providers by communicating with senior management and reviewing the organizational reporting structure and board meeting agendas or minutes.  Internal providers of assurance and advice include functions that may report to or be part of senior management, such as compliance, environmental, financial control, health and safety, information security, legal, risk management, and quality assurance.  External assurance providers may report to senior management, external stakeholders, or the chief audit executive.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Aligning Work ● Agree Techniques ● Share Programs ● Joint Assessments ● Shared Risks ● Combined Reports/Examples of coordination include: • Synchronizing the nature, extent, and timing of planned work.  • Establishing a common understanding of assurance techniques, methods, and terminology.  • Providing access to one another’s work programs and reports.  • Using management’s risk management information to provide joint risk assessments.  • Creating a shared risk register or list of risks.  • Combining results for joint reporting.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Coordination Varies ● Maintain Confidentiality ● Share Information/The process of coordinating assurance activities varies by organization, from informal in small organizations to formal and complex in large or heavily regulated organizations.  The chief audit executive considers the organization’s confidentiality requirements before meeting with the various providers to gather the information necessary to coordinate services.  Frequently, the providers share the objectives, scope, and timing of upcoming engagements and the results of prior engagements.  The providers also discuss the potential for relying on one another’s work.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Assurance Mapping ● Identify Gaps ● Combined Approach/One method to coordinate assurance coverage is to create an assurance map, or a matrix of the organization’s risks and the internal and external providers of assurance services that cover those risks.  The assurance map links identified significant risk categories with relevant sources of assurance and provides an evaluation of the level of assurance for each risk category.  Because the map is comprehensive, it exposes gaps and duplications in assurance coverage, enabling the chief audit executive to evaluate the sufficiency of assurance services in each risk area.  The results can be discussed with the other assurance providers so that the parties may reach an agreement about how to coordinate activities.  In a combined assurance approach, the chief audit executive coordinates the internal audit function’s assurance engagements with other assurance providers to reduce the frequency and redundancy of engagements, maximizing the efficiency of assurance coverage.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Use Experts ● Less Testing/The chief audit executive may choose to rely on the work of other providers for various reasons, such as to assess specialty areas outside the internal audit function’s expertise, to decrease the amount of testing needed to complete an engagement, and to enhance risk coverage beyond the resources of the internal audit function.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Conflicts Disclosed ● Reporting Structure ● Verify Qualifications ● Assess Methodology ● Review Findings/To determine whether the internal audit function may rely on the work of another provider, the methodology should consider the provider’s: • Potential or actual conflicts of interest and whether disclosures were made.  • Reporting relationships and the potential impacts of this arrangement.  • Relevance and validity of professional experience, qualifications, and certifications.  • Methodology and the due professional care applied in planning, supervising, documenting, and reviewing the work.  • Findings and conclusions and whether they are reasonable, based on sufficient, reliable, and relevant evidence.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Unreliable Work ● Retest or Independent/After evaluating the work of another assurance provider, the chief audit executive may determine that the internal audit function cannot rely upon the work.  Internal auditors may either retest the work and gather additional information or independently perform assurance services.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Ongoing Reliance ● Document Specs/If the internal audit function intends to rely upon the work of another assurance provider on an ongoing or long-term basis, the parties should document the agreed-upon relationship and specifications for the assurance to be provided and the testing and evidence required to support the assurance.
 DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION  / PRINCIPLE 9 PLAN STRATEGICALLY  / STANDARD 9.5 COORDINATION AND RELIANCE  / EXAMPLES OF EVIDENCE OF CONFORMANCE/● Role Communication ● Assurance Plans ● Reliance Methodology ● Documented Agreements/• Communications regarding distinct assurance and advisory roles and responsibilities, which may be documented in the notes from meetings with individual providers of assurance and advisory services or in minutes of meetings with the board and senior management.  • Assurance maps and/or combined assurance plans that identify which provider is responsible for assurance services in each area.  • Documentation and implementation of the methodology to determine whether to rely on a provider’s work.  • Documented agreements with other assurance providers confirming the specifications of the assurance work they will perform.

 DOMAIN V PERFORMING INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES  / PRINCIPLE 13 PLAN ENGAGEMENTS EFFECTIVELY  / STANDARD 13.4 EVALUATION CRITERIA  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Identify Standards ● Focus Relevant ● Standards Practical ● Compare Standards ● Example Control/As part of gathering information and planning the engagement, internal auditors identify the criteria used by the organization to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the governance, risk management, and control processes of the activity under review.  Internal auditors should focus on the evaluation criteria most relevant to the engagement.  Such criteria should represent the desired state of the activity and be specific and practical.  Internal auditors compare the criteria against the existing state (condition).  For example, if an engagement objective is to assess the effectiveness of the control processes in the activity under review, the criteria could be the expected results or outcomes of the activity’s control processes, while the condition is revealed by the actual outcomes.

Additionally, adequate criteria are necessary for determining the significance of the findings and reaching meaningful conclusions.  Internal auditors use professional judgment to determine whether the organization’s criteria are adequate.  Adequate criteria are relevant, aligned with the objectives of the organization and the activity under review, and produce reliable comparisons.  Examples of adequate criteria include: • Internal (policies, procedures, key performance indicators, or targets for the activity).  • External (laws, regulations, and contractual obligations).  • Authoritative practices (frameworks, standards, guidance, and benchmarks specific to an industry, activity, or profession).  • Established organizational practices.  • Expectations based on the design of a control.  • Procedures that may not be formally documented.

Determining the criteria that are best for achieving the engagement objectives requires internal auditors to apply professional judgment.  Internal auditors may determine that the documented policies, procedures, and/or other criteria lack detail or are otherwise inadequate.  Internal auditors may assist management in determining adequate criteria or may seek input from experts to help identify or develop relevant criteria.  Management’s criteria may appear adequate generally, but internal auditors may suggest better criteria for the engagement.
 DOMAIN V PERFORMING INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES  / PRINCIPLE 13 PLAN ENGAGEMENTS EFFECTIVELY  / STANDARD 13.4 EVALUATION CRITERIA  / CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION/● Inadequate Criteria ● Advisory Services/When the criteria used by the activity under review are inadequate or nonexistent, internal auditors may recommend that management implement the criteria identified by the internal auditors.

For this reason, the external quality assessment of an internal audit function in the public sector should be performed by an assessment team knowledgeable about public sector activities and governance structures. (See also Standard 8.4 External Quality Assessment.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR /  APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR/● Legal Framework ● Laws Defined ● IA Requirements/The public sector is founded upon and governed under a legal framework that includes laws, regulations, administrative orders and rules, and other types of governing requirements specific to the jurisdiction(s) within which an organization operates.  Throughout the Global Internal Audit Standards, the term “laws and/or regulations” is used to represent the legal framework.  Laws and/or regulations may establish the mandate, organizational position, reporting relationship, scope of work, funding, and other requirements of the internal audit function.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR /  APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR/● Compliance Checks ● Improve Efficiency ● Resource Safeguarding ● Goal Alignment/Through such mandates, internal audit functions in the public sector are often required to focus on: • Ensuring compliance with laws and/or regulations.  • Identifying opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of government processes and programs.  • Determining whether public resources are adequately safeguarded and used appropriately to provide services in an equitable manner.  • Assessing whether an organization’s performance aligns with its strategic objectives and goals.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR /  APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR/● Public Sector/The following sections describe situations in which the application of the Standards may differ for internal auditors in the public sector.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● CAE Awareness ● Charter Explanation ● Nonconformance Action/The chief audit executive must be aware of the laws and/or regulations that affect the internal audit function’s ability to fully conform with all provisions in the Standards.  A charter or other documentation may be used to explain how the internal audit function is meeting the requirements of the laws and/or regulations as well as the intent of the Standards.  When conformance is not possible, the chief audit executive must document the reason, make appropriate disclosures, and conform with all other requirements of the Standards. (See also Standards 4.1 Conformance with Global Internal Audit Standards, 6.1 Internal Audit Mandate, 6.2 Internal Audit Charter, 8.3 Quality, 8.4 External Quality Assessment, 12.1 Internal Quality Assessment, and 15.1 Final Engagement Communication.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● Laws as Mandate ● Update Unwarranted ● Focused Review/**Situations in which laws and/or regulations may affect the ability of internal audit functions in the public sector to conform with the Standards:** When laws and/or regulations serve as the internal audit mandate and charter, the chief audit executive may not have the authority or ability to make amendments.  Thus, the requirement in Standard 6.1 Internal Audit Mandate to periodically review the mandate for updates may not be warranted.  However, the chief audit executive could periodically conduct and document a focused review of the mandate and charter to determine that the established path to legal and/or regulatory compliance is accurately defined.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● Disclosure impact ● Audit methods/**Situations in which laws and/or regulations may affect the ability of internal audit functions in the public sector to conform with the Standards:** Public disclosure laws and/or regulations may govern the types of documents that are required to be released to the public and those that cannot be released to the public.  The methodologies of internal audit functions in the public sector should include these requirements. (See also Standards 5.1 Use of Information and 5.2 Protection of Information.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● Private Discussions/**Situations in which laws and/or regulations may affect the ability of internal audit functions in the public sector to conform with the Standards:** Laws and/or regulations may limit the type of private discussions that the chief audit executive may have with the board. (See also the Glossary definition of “board” as well as Standards 6.3 Board and Senior Management Support and 7.1 Organizational Independence.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● Public Meetings ● Report Dissemination/**Situations in which laws and/or regulations may affect the ability of internal audit functions in the public sector to conform with the Standards:** Laws and/or regulations may require internal audit functions in the public sector to present internal audit results at public meetings.  Methodologies for the dissemination of final communications should adhere to these requirements. (See also Standards 11.2 Effective Communication and 15.1 Final Engagement Communication.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● External auditor mandate ● Supreme body authority ● Coordinate externally/**Situations in which laws and/or regulations may affect the ability of internal audit functions in the public sector to conform with the Standards:** In the public sector the external assurance provider is often mandated.  In some jurisdictions, the authority of a supreme audit institution may supersede that of the internal audit function and internal audit functions may be required to adhere to planning as stipulated and conduct joint work.  In Standard 11.1 Building Relationships and Communicating with Stakeholders the internal audit function is required to coordinate with the external assurance provider, and this authority may supersede the coordination role. (See also Standards 6.1 Internal Audit Mandate and 9.5 Coordination and Reliance.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / LAWS AND - OR REGULATIONS/● Wide Stakeholders ● Public Accountability ● Public Input ● Service Users/Internal auditors in the public sector have a broad base of stakeholders, including the public within the jurisdiction as well as appointed and elected officials.  The internal audit function may be legally required to be accountable and transparent to the public.  To adequately serve their stakeholders, internal auditors may consider input from the public when planning and performing internal audit services.  Public input may be provided by users of government services, such as utilities, public transit systems, parks and recreation facilities, building permitting processes, and others. (See also Standards 9.4 Internal Audit Plan, 11.1 Building Relationships and Communicating with Stakeholders, and 13.2 Engagement Risk Assessment.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE/● Governance Variety ● Multiple Layers/Internal audit functions in the public sector are governed under a variety of structures.  Some public sector organizations may be subject to multiple levels of governance, both within and outside the organization, which may complicate the reporting relationships of the chief audit executive as well as the oversight and funding of the function.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE/● Governance Structures ● Board Limitations ● Input on CAE ● Management Defined ● Independence Safeguards/The Global Internal Audit Standards reference responsibilities related to the “board” and “senior management.” The glossary defines “board” using concepts that encompass various governance structures in the public sector.  Because the board in the public sector may be a policy-setting body, it may not have authority over aspects of the chief audit executive and the internal audit function as described in the Standards.  For example, such a body may not be able to appoint, remove, or set remuneration for the chief audit executive.  In those situations, the board should still provide input to management regarding performance evaluations and decisions to appoint and remove the chief audit executive.  In other public sector organizations, “senior management” may be defined differently than it is in the Standards.  When the term is used to refer to the management of the activity under review, safeguards to independence must be implemented to mitigate the risk of interference with the internal audit function’s work.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE/● CAE Direction ● Elected Oversight/The chief audit executive should avoid taking direction from elected officials without first consulting the board and senior management, who directly oversee the internal audit function, unless the officials have direct oversight responsibilities.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE/● Separate, Legislative ● Top, Government ● Within, Tiered ● Separate, Elected ● Lower, Manager/The examples below describe governance and organizational structures in which internal audit functions may need to adjust the application of some standards (the list is not exhaustive): • Internal audit functions may be separate from other parts of the organization, and the chief audit executive reports directly to a legislative body that functions as a board.  • Internal audit functions may be placed at the highest level of the government organization, and the chief audit executive reports directly to the head of the organization.  • Internal audit functions may be placed within another component of the overall organization (such as a department or other unit within a government organization), and the chief audit executive reports to the head of the organization or a nonexecutive/supervisory board.  • This may occur when there is a tiered governance structure and where there is more than one governing body.  • Internal audit functions may be separate from other parts of the organization because the chief audit executive is elected and retained by the voters within a jurisdiction and does not report to any specific oversight body or person in the organization.  • Internal audit functions may be placed lower in the organization, and the chief audit executive reports to a single senior manager from that department
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE/● Audit Committee ● Improves Independence ● Related Standards/While some of these situations do not meet the independence requirements in the Global Internal Audit Standards, establishing an audit committee comprising public members, independent of management, safeguards independence and provides ongoing oversight, advice, and feedback. (See also Standards 6.2 Internal Audit Charter and 6.3 Board and Senior Management Support, Principle 7 Positioned Independently and its standards, and Standard 8.1 Board Interaction.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Funding Varies ● Limited Control ● Funding Limits/The funding processes for internal audit functions vary widely in the public sector.  Some governance and organizational structures do not give the board and senior management authority over the budget.  These conditions prevent the chief audit executive from being able to seek budget approval from the board and senior management and limit the ability to seek or obtain additional funding due to other funding priorities within the organization.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Independent Budget ● Part of Budget ● CAE Advocacy/For example, some internal audit functions within the public sector can submit independent budget requests to their board or legislative body for approval.  Others’ budgets are part of a larger organizational budget, and the allocation to the internal audit function is determined by the head of the organization and often approved by an outside legislative body.  In either case, the chief audit executive could advocate to the board for the resources needed.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Budget Compliance ● Standards Adherence/Even when the budget is set by laws and/or regulations, the chief audit executive must adhere to other requirements of the standards related to managing the budget. (See also Standards 6.3 Board and Senior Management Support, 7.1 Organizational Independence, 8.2 Resources, and 10.1 Financial Resource Management.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Funding Limits ● Pay Ranges ● HR Collaboration/**Public sector conditions may limit the way the chief audit executive may spend allocated funds:** • The position classification structure and/or labor agreements often establish pay ranges for each position classification based on the knowledge, skills, and responsibilities of the position that limit the authority of the chief audit executive or board to establish the remuneration for each employee.  In such situations, the chief audit executive should collaborate with the human resources function, as described in Standard 10.2 Human Resources Management.
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Spending limits ● Limited technology ● Board advocacy/**Public sector conditions may limit the way the chief audit executive may spend allocated funds:** The internal audit function may be required to use only software approved for the organization, which may limit the chief audit executive’s ability to obtain technology to support the internal audit function.  Internal audit functions in the public sector should engage their board as advocates for supporting their technology needs and may need to use software available to achieve the audit plan in the most efficient way possible while maintaining conformance with the Standards. (See also Standard 10.3 Technological Resources.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Funding Limits ● Peer Reviews/**Public sector conditions may limit the way the chief audit executive may spend allocated funds:** When funding limitations prevent the chief audit executive from obtaining adequate resources to conduct an external quality assessment, internal audit functions in the public sector may benefit from participating in peer programs to conduct the assessment. (See also Standards 8.4 External Quality Assessment and 10.1 Financial Resource Management.)
 APPLYING THE GLOBAL INTERNAL AUDIT STANDARDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  / FUNDING/● Funding Limits ● Report Sharing/**Public sector conditions may limit the way the chief audit executive may spend allocated funds:** When an outside authority or oversight body provides the funding for the internal audit function in the public sector, the chief audit executive may be required to provide final engagement communications to the funding authority. (See also Standards 11.1 Building Relationships and Communicating with Stakeholders, 11.2 Effective Communication, and 15.1 Final Engagement Communication.)
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE /  THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE/● Standards Updated ● IPPF Updates ● 2017 IPPF/The extensive reimagination that has resulted in the new Global Internal Audit Standards marks a significant milestone for the profession.  While the International Professional Practices Framework, including the Standards, has been updated periodically, many of the improvements have not always been perfectly integrated.  For example, specific Standards-related guidance was difficult to find.  Moreover, 2017’s International Professional Practices Framework added a mission and core principles to the mix, but critics argued that it did not fully explain how those concepts related to the existing Standards.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE /  THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE/● Easier to Use ● Combined Guidance ● Five Domains/To make the Standards clearer and easier to use, the new, wide-ranging structure adds two bold innovations.  First, mandatory elements and implementation guidance now reside under a single roof.  Second, the Standards are organized into five domains that begin with the Purpose of Internal Auditing and end with detailed descriptions of how internal audit services must be delivered.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE /  THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE/● Standards Principles ● Five Domains ● Flows Purpose/The new structure reemphasizes that the Standards are based on principles.  If one can imagine the five domains of the Standards as a set of building blocks, the governing principle of all principles can be found in the Purpose of Internal Auditing.  From there everything else flows.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE /  THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE/● Domain Structure ● Easy Navigation/In addition, each domain — except the purpose statement — has a hierarchical structure: principles at the top, followed by the required standards and implementation practices, and, finally, examples of how conformance can be achieved.  Internal auditors can now visualize how the different domains relate to each other and find what they need within the Standards much more easily.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING/● Strengthen Value ● Achieve Objectives ● Strengthen Processes/The new Standards do much more than simply reorganize existing material.  Domain I prominently heralds internal auditing’s value.  To that end, the Purpose of Internal Auditing now says: “Internal auditing strengthens the organization’s ability to create, protect, and sustain value by providing the board and management with independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.” Internal audit accomplishes this by enhancing the organization’s:  • Ability to successfully achieve its objectives.  • Governance, risk management, and control processes.  • Decision-making and oversight processes.  • Reputation and credibility with its stakeholders.  • Ability to serve the public interest.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING/● Ambitious Purpose ● Achieve Goals ● Serve Public/Dominique Vincenti, vice president and CAE at ride-sharing company Uber, based in San Francisco, is the International Internal Audit Standards Board (IIASB) member who led the reworking of the purpose statement and Domain III, Governing the Internal Audit Function.  “The purpose that we have developed is a tall order for internal audit,” she says.  “Not only does it position internal audit as helping organizations achieve their objectives and make the right decisions, but it also enhances their ability to serve the public interest.”
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING/● Public Interest ● ESG Importance/Not all organizations aim to serve the public interest, but Vincenti is unapologetic about its inclusion in the Standards.  In an age in which environmental, social, and governance has not only become a big topic of consumer discourse, but also aligns with an increasingly socially conscious institutional investor base, it is a bold but necessary move.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN I PURPOSE OF INTERNAL AUDITING/● Standard Support ● Stakeholder Demand/Because the Standards are recognized and supported by a wide range of influential stakeholders — including many stock exchanges — a CAE should be able to go to the executive team and the board to discuss this expanded remit, Vincenti explains.  “It is aspirational in the sense that many CAEs are not yet in a position where they fulfill such a role, but necessary because in today’s world this is what stakeholders are demanding,” she says.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Ethics Domain ● Five Principles/The second set of principles are contained in Domain II.  This domain encompasses both the existing Code of Ethics, some principles from the 2017 Standards, and what were previously referred to as attribute standards — namely those concerned with objectivity, competency, confidentiality, and due professional care.  The 13 standards in this domain are organized under five principles: demonstrate integrity, maintain objectivity, demonstrate competency, exercise due professional care, and maintain confidentiality.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Ethical Behavior ● Behavioral Aspects ● Naji Fayad/Domain II is a thoughtful rationalization of what ethical behavior is expected of internal audit practitioners.  “We wanted to take the behavioral aspects of internal auditing and bring them together in one place to make them more visible, more effective, and less confusing,” says Naji Fayad, working group leader of Domain II and chief internal audit officer at Cenomi Centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Professional Courage ● Integrity Foundation ● Job Risk/One key change has been to elevate the concept of professional courage — something that has been implied by the Standards and advocated by CAEs and industry professionals for many years.  “You cannot define integrity without having the notion of being courageous in saying what you think without being afraid of the consequences,” Fayad explains.  In simple terms, internal auditors are expected to tell the truth and do the right thing — even when it is uncomfortable or difficult.  During the consultation period, commenters raised concerns that internal auditors would be forced to act in ways that could cost them their jobs.  But, he says: “The concept of integrity is the foundation of the other ethical principles and is meant to encourage CAEs to use their professionalism to earn trust among stakeholders and create an environment where integrity and honesty are the norm — which means leading by example.”  
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN II ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM/● Skill Improvement ● No CPE Mandate ● Individual Responsibility ● Development Plans/The Standards also require internal auditors to continually develop their competencies, including pursuing professional development through education and training.  However, the Standards stop short of requiring a specific number of continuing professional education (CPE) hours.  The IIA’s Professional Certifications Board will continue to set CPE requirements, but the CAE and individual internal auditors must determine how to develop those competencies in line with their position and job requirements.  However, the Standards recommend internal auditors create self-development plans and CAEs establish minimum requirements for practitioners and plans to obtain competencies across the audit function.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Board Authorization ● Requires Balance ● Board's Job ● Contradictory Requirement/Domain III comprises three core principles: how the board authorizes the internal audit function, the function’s organizational independence, and internal audit oversight (see “Domain III: Strengthening Governance”).  In many ways, Domain III has required a particularly careful balancing act.  Strictly speaking, CAEs are not responsible for the governance structure of the organizations in which they serve — that is the board’s job.  Having requirements for the CAE in this area feels contradictory: How can one be required to do something outside of one’s control?
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Domain Challenge ● CAE Conditions ● Board Responsibility/Vincenti admits that Domain III was a difficult area to finalize because it is not the Standards’ purpose to tell the board and management how to run their affairs.  What is crucial is the requirements exist so that CAEs can clearly explain the essential conditions that must be in place if CAEs are to perform their jobs effectively and in line with the Standards.  “The CAE can explain that it is part of the role of the board to ensure those conditions exist,” she says.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● CAE Explanation ● Board Governance ● Meeting Goals/If those arrangements are not going to be met, the CAE can then explain that the internal audit function will not achieve full conformance with the Standards.  “A conform or explain mechanism is a powerful tool for CAEs because it will make boards think twice about their governance structures,” she explains.  “It will also ensure that CAEs can still follow the Standards and meet their intent without having the essential conditions being perfectly met.”  
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN III GOVERNING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Standards Challenges ● Mechanism Support/Vincenti accepts that for many organizations — including privately owned family businesses, public sector bodies, and smaller companies — such conformance with essential conditions may represent a challenge.  However, there now is a mechanism to drive conversations and push best practices without the CAE having to take unnecessary risks or fail to conform to the Standards because of something outside of his or her control.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● CAE responsibilities ● Strategic planning ● Misconceptions arose/The first of two domains focusing on internal audit activities, Domain IV, Managing the Internal Audit Function, focuses on the CAE’s responsibilities and has four principles: planning strategically, managing resources, communicating effectively, and enhancing quality.  The need to plan strategically is a new requirement to ensure the internal audit function delivers on its purpose to help the organization achieve its objectives.  Doron Ronen, president of IIA–Israel and IIASB working group leader on Domain IV, says during the Standards consultation phase there were a lot of misconceptions about what planning strategically was meant to achieve.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Managers Strategize ● CAE Lead/“Every senior manager in an organization must have a strategy and, because the CAE is one of those managers, that must also apply to him or her,” he explains.  “CAEs cannot demand of their peers a strategy without leading by example.”
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Audit Strategy ● Purpose & Strategy ● Strategy Examples/Standard 9.2 Internal Audit Strategy clarifies the link between internal audit’s purpose and its strategy: “The chief audit executive must develop and implement a strategy for the internal audit function that supports the strategic objectives and success of the organization and aligns with the expectations of the board, senior management, and other key stakeholders.” The strategy must be reviewed with the board and senior management periodically.  The Standards also include examples of how to develop an effective internal audit strategy.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● CAE Responsibility ● Internal ●> External ● Domain III/Another major enhancement focuses on the thorny issue of quality.  First, Standard 12.1 Internal Quality Assessment sets out the CAE’s responsibility for ensuring the internal audit function conforms with the Standards and has a program of continuous performance improvement monitored by internal quality assessments.  These internal assessments should feed into the external quality assessment, which now sits in Domain III because it is a matter that needs to be discussed with the board.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN IV MANAGING THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Performance Measurement ● Substantive Issues/To aid these assessments, internal auditors may welcome the level of clarity and support given in areas such as Standard 12.2 Performance Measurement, which provides considerations for implementation and examples of evidence of conformance.  “These sections go into the essence of internal audit and focus on substantive issues — not just compliance,” Ronen says.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN V PERFORMING INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES/● Advisory Engagements ● Increased Demand ● Conform to Standards/Over the past few years, organizations have increasingly tasked CAEs with conducting advisory engagements to rapidly assess fast-moving threats.  The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and levels of geopolitical uncertainty mean that such services are in high demand.  Harriet Richardson, retired inspector general at San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit and working group leader of Domain V, Performing Internal Audit Services, says the domain ensures practitioners understand they must conform with the Standards when providing assurance audits and advisory engagements.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN V PERFORMING INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES/● Standard Compliance ● Advisory Exception/“Unless a standard explicitly says you do not have to follow it during an advisory engagement, then internal auditors should assume they must follow the standard in full,” she says.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / DOMAIN V PERFORMING INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES/● Assess Findings ● Communicate Well ● Document & Communicate/As well as establishing basic principles for evaluating findings, the Standards encourage internal auditors to develop their own way of rating and ranking risk.  But throughout, the document makes clear the need for internal auditors to communicate effectively across their organizations.  “There is much more emphasis on documenting your work and communicating as you go along, so there is an approach of no surprises,” Richardson says.
 THE FIVE DOMAINS A DEEP DIVE  / BUILDING ON A STRUCTURE/● Timelier Updates ● Solid Structure/Standard-setting is a tough business.  With a new framework in place, Vincenti says the IIASB has been working out better processes to update future versions timelier.  So, while the latest Standards should be seen as a major clarification and synthesis of internal audit’s professional practices, they also put in place a sound structure and process for whatever comes next.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION/● Complex Environment ● Conflicting Interests ● Management Authority/Organizations are human undertakings operating in an increasingly uncertain, complex, interconnected, and volatile world.  They often have multiple stakeholders with diverse, changeable, and sometimes competing interests.  Stakeholders entrust organizational oversight to a governing body, which in turn delegates resources and authority to management to take appropriate actions, including managing risk.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION/● Effective Structures ● Audit Reliance ● Governance Accountability/For these reasons and more, organizations need effective structures and processes to enable the achievement of objectives while supporting strong governance and risk management.  As the governing body receives reports from management on activities, outcomes, and forecasts, both the governing body and management rely on the internal audit function to provide independent, objective assurance and advisory services on all matters and to promote and facilitate innovation and improvement.  The governing body is ultimately accountable for governance, which is achieved through the actions and behaviors of the governing body as well as management and internal audit.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION/● Structures, Processes ● Governance, Risk/The Three Lines Model helps organizations identify structures and processes that best assist the achievement of objectives and facilitate strong governance and risk management.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION/● Adaptable Model ● Value Creation ● Role Clarity ● Stakeholder Alignment/The model applies to all organizations and is optimized by:  • Adopting a principles-based approach and adapting the model to suit organizational objectives and circumstances.  • Focusing on the contribution risk management makes to achieving objectives and creating value, as well as to matters of “defense” and protecting value.  • Clearly understanding the roles and responsibilities represented in the model and the relationships among them.  • Implementing measures to ensure activities and objectives are aligned with the prioritized interests of stakeholders.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Structured Group/organization – An organized group of activities, resources, and people working toward shared goals.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Interested Party ● Example Parties/stakeholder* – A party with a direct or indirect interest in an organization's activities and outcomes. Stakeholders may include the board, management, employees, customers, vendors, shareholders, regulatory agencies, financial institutions, external auditors, the public, and others.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Top authority ● Multiple bodies/governing body – The highest-level body charged with governance, termed "board" in the Global Internal Audit Standards. In an organization that has more than one governing body, board refers to the body/bodies authorized to provide the internal audit function with the appropriate authority, role, and responsibilities.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Management Definition/management – Those individuals, teams, and support functions assigned to provide products and/or services to the organization’s clients.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Independent service ● Achieving goals/internal auditing* – An independent, objective assurance and advisory service designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Assurance & Advice/internal audit function* – A professional individual or group responsible for providing an organization with assurance and advisory services.
THREE LINES MODEL  / INTRODUCTION  / KEY TERMS/● Control Definition/control* – Any action taken by management, the board, and other parties to manage risk and increase the likelihood that established objectives and goals will be achieved.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 1 GOVERNANCE/● Governing Body Accountable ● Management Risk Action ● Independent Audit Assurance/The governance of an organization requires appropriate structures and processes that enable:  • Accountability by a governing body to stakeholders for organizational oversight through integrity, leadership, and transparency.  • Actions (including managing risk) by management to achieve the objectives of the organization through risk-based decision- making and application of resources.  • Assurance and advice by an independent internal audit function to provide clarity and confidence and to promote and facilitate continuous improvement through rigorous inquiry and insightful communication.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 2 GOVERNING BODY ROLES/● Governance Structures ● Align Objectives/The governing body ensures:  • Appropriate structures and processes are in place for effective governance.  • Organizational objectives and activities are aligned with the prioritized interests of stakeholders.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 2 GOVERNING BODY ROLES/● Delegate Resources ● Audit Oversight/The governing body:  • Delegates responsibility and provides resources to management to achieve the objectives of the organization while ensuring legal, regulatory, and ethical expectations are met.  • Establishes and oversees an independent, objective, and competent internal audit function to provide clarity and confidence on progress toward the achievement of objectives.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 3 MANAGEMENT AND FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES/● Meeting Goals ● First Line ● Second Line/Management’s responsibility to achieve organizational objectives comprises both first and second line roles. First line roles are most directly aligned with the delivery of products and/or services to clients of the organization and include the roles of support functions.  Second line roles assist with managing risk.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 3 MANAGEMENT AND FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES/● Familiar Terms ● Roles, Not Structure ● Governing Body ● Concurrent Roles/**first and second line roles** The language of “first line,” “second line,” and “third line” is retained from the original model in the interests of familiarity.  However, the “lines” are not intended to denote structural elements but a useful differentiation in roles.  Logically, governing body roles also constitute a “line” but this convention has not been adopted to avoid confusion.  The numbering (first, second, third) should not be taken to imply sequential operations.  Instead, all roles operate concurrently.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 3 MANAGEMENT AND FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES/● Support functions ● First●line scope/**support functions** Some consider the roles of support functions (such as HR, administration, and building services) to be second line roles.  For clarity, the Three Lines Model regards first line roles to include both “front of house” and “back office” activities, and second line roles to comprise those complementary activities focused on risk-related matters.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 3 MANAGEMENT AND FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES/● Blended or Separate ● Specialist Support ● Focus Areas ● Broader ERM ● Management Responsibility/First and second line roles may be blended or separated.  Some second line roles may be assigned to specialists to provide complementary expertise, support, monitoring, and challenge to those with first line roles.  Second line roles can focus on specific objectives of risk management, such as: compliance with laws, regulations, and acceptable ethical behavior; controls; information and technology security; sustainability; and quality assurance.  Alternatively, second line roles may span a broader responsibility for risk management, such as enterprise risk management (ERM).  However, responsibility for managing risk remains a part of first line roles and within the scope of management.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 4 THIRD LINE ROLES/● Assurance & Advice ● Reporting Findings ● Consider Assurance/The internal audit function provides independent and objective assurance and advice on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance and risk management. (In some organizations, other third line roles are identified, such as oversight, inspection, investigation, evaluation, and remediation, which may be part of the internal audit function or operate separately. It achieves this through the competent application of systematic and disciplined processes, expertise, and insight.)  It reports its findings to management and the governing body to promote and facilitate continuous improvement.  In doing so, it may consider assurance from other internal and external providers.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 5 THIRD LINE INDEPENDENCE/● Audit Independence ● Ensuring Independence ● Freedom to Audit/Internal audit’s independence from the responsibilities of management is critical to its objectivity, authority, and credibility.  It is established through accountability to the governing body; unfettered access to people, resources, and data needed to complete its work; and freedom from bias or interference in the planning and delivery of audit services.
THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLES OF THE THREE LINES MODEL  / PRINCIPLE 6 CREATING AND PROTECTING VALUE/● Collective Contribution ● Align Activities ● Reliable Information/All roles working together collectively contribute to the creation and protection of value when they are aligned with each other and with the prioritized interests of stakeholders.  Alignment of activities is achieved through communication, cooperation, and collaboration.  This ensures the reliability, coherence, and transparency of information needed for risk-based decision-making.

THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Responsibility varies ● High●level roles/Organizations differ considerably in their distribution of responsibilities.  However, the following high-level roles serve to amplify the Principles of the Three Lines Model.
THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Accountable Oversight ● Transparent Communication ● Ethical Culture ● Governance Structure ● Delegate Responsibility ● Risk Appetite ● Oversee Compliance ● Audit Function/Governing body  • Accepts accountability to stakeholders for oversight of the organization.  • Engages with stakeholders to monitor their interests and communicate transparently on the achievement of objectives.  • Nurtures a culture promoting ethical behavior and accountability.  • Establishes structures and processes for governance, including auxiliary committees as required.  • Delegates responsibility and provides resources to management for achieving the objectives of the organization.  • Determines organizational appetite for risk and exercises oversight of risk management (including controls).  • Maintains oversight of compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical expectations.  • Establishes and oversees an independent, objective, and competent internal audit function.
THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Lead & Direct ● Communicate Results ● Establish Structures ● Ensure Compliance/**Management** First line roles  • Leads and directs actions (including managing risk) and application of resources to achieve the objectives of the organization.  • Maintains a continuous dialogue with the governing body, and reports on planned, actual, and expected outcomes linked to the objectives of the organization; and risk.  • Establishes and maintains appropriate structures and processes for the management of operations and risk (including controls).  • Ensures compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical expectations.
THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Expertise & Support ● Achieve Objectives ● Analyze & Report/**Management** Second line roles  • Provides complementary expertise, support, monitoring, and challenge related to the management of risk, including:      - The development, implementation, and continuous improvement of risk management practices (including controls) at a process, systems, and entity level.      - The achievement of risk management objectives, such as: compliance with laws, regulations, and acceptable ethical behavior; controls; information and technology security; sustainability; and quality assurance.  • Provides analysis and reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management (including controls).
THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Accountable & Independent ● Assurance & Advice ● Report Impairments/Internal audit function  • Maintains primary accountability to the governing body and independence from the responsibilities of management.  • Communicates independent and objective assurance and advice to management and the governing body on the adequacy and effectiveness of governance and risk management (including controls) to support the achievement of organizational objectives and to promote and facilitate continuous improvement.  • Reports impairments to independence and objectivity to the governing body and implements safeguards as required.
THREE LINES MODEL  / KEY ROLES IN THE THREE LINES MODEL/● Legal needs ● Fulfill requests/External assurance providers  • Provide additional assurance to:      - Satisfy legislative and regulatory expectations that serve to protect the interests of stakeholders.      - Satisfy requests by management and the governing body to complement internal sources of assurance.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / BETWEEN THE GOVERNING BODY AND MANAGEMENT (BOTH FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES)/● Set Direction ● Management Responsibility ● Management Reporting/The governing body typically sets the direction of the organization by defining the vision, mission, values, and organizational appetite for risk.  It then delegates responsibility for the achievement of the organization’s objectives to management, along with the necessary resources.  The governing body receives reports from management on planned, actual, and expected outcomes, as well as reports on risk and the management of risk.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / BETWEEN THE GOVERNING BODY AND MANAGEMENT (BOTH FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES)/● Role Overlap ● Governing Involvement ● Strategic Planning ● CEO's Role ● Strong Communication ● Senior Managers ● Second Line Reporting ● Model Alignment/Organizations vary as to the degree of overlap and separation between the roles of the governing body and management.  The governing body can be more or less “hands on” with respect to strategic and operational matters.  Either the governing body or management may take the lead in developing the strategic plan, or it may be a shared undertaking.  In some jurisdictions, the CEO (chief executive officer (CEO) – The most senior individual in the organization with responsibility over operations.) may be a member of the governing body and may even be its chair.  In all cases, there needs to be strong communication between management and the governing body.  The CEO is typically the focal point for this communication, but other senior managers may have frequent interactions with the governing body.  Organizations may wish, and their regulators may require, leaders of second line roles such as a chief risk officer and a chief compliance officer to have a direct reporting line to the governing body.  This is fully consistent with the Principles of the Three Lines Model.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / BETWEEN MANAGEMENT (BOTH FIRST AND SECOND LINE ROLES) AND THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION/● Audit Independence ● Regular Interaction ● Trusted Advisor ● Collaboration Needed/Internal audit’s independence from management ensures it is free from hindrance and bias in its planning and in the carrying out of its work, enjoying unfettered access to the people, resources, and information it requires.  It is accountable to the governing body.  However, independence does not imply isolation.  There must be regular interaction between the internal audit function and management to ensure internal audit work is relevant and aligned with the strategic and operational needs of the organization.  Through all its activities, the internal audit function builds its knowledge and understanding of the organization, which contributes to the assurance and advisory services it delivers as a trusted advisor and strategic partner.  There is a need for collaboration and communication across both the first and second line roles of management and the internal audit function to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication, overlap, or gaps.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / BETWEEN THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION AND THE GOVERNING BODY/● Audit Reports/The internal audit function is accountable to, and sometimes described as being the “eyes and ears” of, the governing body.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / BETWEEN THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION AND THE GOVERNING BODY/● Independence & CAE ● CAE Reporting ● Open Access/The governing body is responsible for oversight of internal audit, which requires: ensuring an independent internal audit function is established, including the hiring and firing of the chief audit executive; serving as the primary reporting line for the CAE (chief audit executive (CAE)* – The leadership role responsible for effectively managing all aspects of the internal audit function and ensuring the quality performance of internal audit services in accordance with Global Internal Audit Standards. The specific job title and/or responsibilities may vary across organizations.); approving and resourcing the audit plan; receiving and considering reports from the CAE; and enabling free access by the CAE to the governing body, including private sessions without the presence of management.
THREE LINES MODEL  / RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CORE ROLES  / AMONG ALL ROLES/● Roles align ● Need communication/The governing body, management, and the internal audit function have their distinct responsibilities, but all activities need to be aligned with the objectives of the organization.  The basis for successful coherence is regular and effective coordination, collaboration, and communication.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / STRUCTURE, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES/● Model Customization ● Structure & Roles ● Governing Committees ● Management Structure/The Three Lines Model is most effective when it is adapted to align with the objectives and circumstances of the organization.  How an organization is structured and how roles are assigned are matters for management and the governing body to determine.  The governing body may establish committees to provide additional oversight for particular aspects of its responsibility, such as audit, risk, finance, planning, and compensation.  Within management, there are likely to be functional and hierarchical arrangements and an increasing tendency toward specialization as organizations grow in size and complexity.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / STRUCTURE, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES/● Combined Roles ● Independent Second●Line ● Multiple Reporting ● Statutory Requirement ● Risk Management/Functions, teams, and even individuals may have responsibilities that include both first and second line roles.  However, direction and oversight of second line roles may be designed to secure a degree of independence from those with first line roles — and even from the most senior levels of management — by establishing primary accountability and reporting lines to the governing body.  The Three Lines Model allows for as many reporting lines between management and the governing body as required.  In some organizations, most notably regulated financial institutions, there is a statutory requirement for such arrangements to ensure sufficient independence.  Even in these situations, those in management with first line roles remain responsible for managing risk.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / STRUCTURE, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES/● Monitoring & Advice ● Management Support/Second line roles may include monitoring, advice, guidance, testing, analyzing, and reporting on matters related to the management of risk.  Insofar as these provide support and challenge to those with first line roles and are integral to management decisions and actions, second line roles are part of management’s responsibilities and are never fully independent from management, regardless of reporting lines and accountabilities.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / STRUCTURE, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES/● Third Line Independence ● Audit Role Value ● Avoid Management Duties ● CAE Management Duties/A defining characteristic of third line roles is independence from management.  The Principles of the Three Lines Model describe the importance and nature of internal audit independence, setting the internal audit function apart from other functions and enabling the distinctive value of its assurance and advisory services.  The internal audit function’s independence is safeguarded by not making decisions or taking actions that are part of management’s responsibilities (including risk management) and by declining to provide assurance on activities for which the function has current, or has had recent, responsibility.  For example, in some organizations, the CAE is asked to assume additional decision-making responsibilities over activities utilizing similar competencies, such as aspects of statutory compliance or ERM.  In such circumstances, the internal audit function is not independent of these activities or of their results, and therefore, when the governing body seeks independent and objective assurance and advice relating to those areas, it is necessary for its provision to be undertaken by a qualified third party.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / OVERSIGHT AND ASSURANCE/● Governing Oversight ● Management Assurance ● Second●Line Assurance ● IA Objectivity ● External Assurance/The governing body relies on reports from management (comprising those with first and second line roles), internal audit, and others in order to exercise oversight and achievement of its objectives, for which it is accountable to stakeholders.  Management provides valuable assurance (also referred to as attestations) on planned, actual, and forecast outcomes, on risk, and on risk management by drawing upon direct experience and expertise.  Those with second line roles provide additional assurance on risk-related matters.  Because of internal audit’s independence from management, the assurance it provides carries the highest degree of objectivity and confidence beyond that which those with first and second line roles can provide to the governing body, irrespective of reporting lines.  Further assurance may also be drawn from external providers.
THREE LINES MODEL  / APPLYING THE MODEL  / COORDINATION AND ALIGNMENT/● Clear Roles ● Audit Confirmation/Effective governance requires appropriate assignment of responsibilities as well as strong alignment of activities through cooperation, collaboration, and communication.  The governing body seeks confirmation through the internal audit function that governance structures and processes are appropriately designed and operating as intended.
